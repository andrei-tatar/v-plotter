## Synopsis

A Box2D based hanging plotter simulator. The underlying physics engine enables to test
the algorithms for a hanging plotter without risking a bug in the simulator engine.
It is also a very nice way to test my SVG to GCode converter, [juicy-gcode](https://github.com/domoszlai/juicy-gcode).

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser, copy past some gcode (or try the default one) into the textarea and push the run button.
The plotter start to draw in a realistic way right away.

Keep in mind that the drawing area of the plotter is 80cm x 80cm. Out of this area the plotter bacomes unrealistic as I used
Box2D distance joint for the strings, because it does not offer a proper rope implementation.

## Limitations

It is mainly designed to work with the gcode generated by [juicy-gcode](https://github.com/domoszlai/juicy-gcode).
It should work with every kind of gcode, but it is not well tested.
The plotter draws when the Z coordinate is 0.

## Bugs

Please file an issue if you run into a problem (or drop me an email to dlacko @ gmail.com).
