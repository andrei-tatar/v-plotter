## Synopsis

A Box2D based V (hanging) plotter simulator. The underlying physics engine enables to test
the algorithms for a V plotter without risking a bug in the simulator engine.
It is also a very nice way to test my SVG to GCode converter, [juicy-gcode](https://github.com/domoszlai/juicy-gcode).

## Usage

For executing gcode, open `sym_gcode.html` in a web browser, copy some gcode (or try the default one) into the textarea and push the run button.
For executing steps generated by [`gensteps.js`](https://github.com/domoszlai/v-plotter/blob/master/gensteps.js), use `sym_steps.html` instead.

You can also run them directly: [gcode](https://domoszlai.github.io/v-plotter/simulator/sym_gcode.html), [steps](https://domoszlai.github.io/v-plotter/simulator/sym_gcode.html).

Please note that the drawing area of the plotter is 80cm x 80cm; out of this area the plotter becomes unrealistic as I used
Box2D distance joint for the strings, because it does not offer a proper rope implementation.

## Limitations

It is mainly designed to work with the gcode generated by [juicy-gcode](https://github.com/domoszlai/juicy-gcode).
It should work with every kind of gcode, but it is not well tested.
The plotter draws when the Z coordinate is 0.

## Bugs

Please file an issue if you run into a problem (or drop me an email to dlacko@gmail.com).
